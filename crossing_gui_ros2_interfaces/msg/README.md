# About .msg files



## Naming conventions

- Message files are used to determine the class name of the autogenerated code. As such, they must be CamelCased. e.g. **LaserScan.msg**

    - *NOTE: This is an exception to the convention that all filenames are lower case and underscore separated. Using CamelCase message names will prevent issues from arising due to inconsistent support for filename case sensitivity across various operating systems.*

- Message fields should be lowercase with underscore separation. e.g. **range_min**
