Official Documentation for tests:
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Intermediate/Testing/Python.html

Your test code needs to go in a folder named "tests" in the root of your package.
This is that folder.

Naming:
Any file that contains tests that you want to run must have the pattern test_FOO.py where FOO can be replaced with anything.
